																<h3>Voice</h3>
																<p>I've always enjoyed reading for others, and multiple times I've been told that I have a good voice for it. Some years ago, at the suggestions of colleagues, I studied a few courses with <a href="http://www.voiceone.com">Voice One</a> and lent my vocal training and talents to a series of marketing promos for several of Weldon Owen's books.</p>
																<p>Production values were somewhere between "modest" and "DIY", but Gonzalo Ferreyra and the marketing team at Weldon Owen managed to make it work, and it was a good way to demonstrate some range and show off a few titles I'd taken part in creating.</p>
                <p>In addition, this set of voiceovers not only gave me experience working directly with sales and marketing, but allowed me a chance to display them hereusing ReactJS.</p>
